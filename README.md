# Vanilla+ Library: Crafting Tweaks
This datapacks recreates the [Crafting Tweaks mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-tweaks) for the Universal Crafting Table. Simply install it just like any other datapack and all the Universal Crafting Tables from your world will have these useful features. Disabling the datapack will also uninstall it without any problem. Crafting Tweaks adds 3 buttons to the GUI for an easy manipulation of the crafting grid:
- Rotate grid: It rotates the outer circle in the grid clockwise(anticlockise if clicked while pressing SHIFT).
- Balance grid: Evenly distributes the stacks in the grid, SHIFT + click it to spread the ingredients to empty slots.
- Clear grid: Dumps all items in the grid to your inventory(It'll drop the items if the inventory is full).
